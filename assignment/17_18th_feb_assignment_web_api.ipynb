    "Definition of an API\n",
    "An API, or application programming interface, enables interaction between software applications, systems, or platforms to send and receive data. An API is the messenger that delivers your data request to an external source and then returns their reply to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The word “application” can be used to refer to many things. In the context of an API, it can be a piece of software with a distinct function, a small part of an app, a whole app, or a whole server. \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are used for different purposes across all types of software and can be open to the public, restricted between strategic partners, for internal use only, or a composite of other data and service APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples of APIs today\n",
    "We all interact with APIs on a daily basis, even if we aren’t aware of it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you’ve gone to log in or register with a website, and seen the option to ‘login using Facebook, Google or Apple’? This feature is enabled by an API; authenticating the user’s identity, without actually logging into the social media account at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using PayPal to buy directly from an e-commerce store is another example of API functionality. The e-commerce site can access the information it needs to complete the transaction, but cannot access the customer’s sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We even rely on APIs when looking for a cheap vacation. When searching a price comparison site, the site aggregates multiple options and showcases the cheapest ones by using third-party APIs to collect information from online travel agents or airlines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do APIs work?\n",
    "APIs work by acting as the link between the user and the service provider, with the API software facilitating an exchange to take place. Whether that is an information request, an e-commerce transaction, sending money to a bank account, or any other situation requiring a two-way data transfer. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform an action on a website, the API will send online data related to your action to its server. Subsequently, the server receives and interprets the data, completes the necessary activity, and then returns the outcome to the application. The application interprets the outcome data and shows you the answer in an understandable format."

    "**What is API?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Josh Walker, an analyst at Forrester Research, describes building an application with no APIs as “basically like building a house with no doors. The API for all computing purposes is how you open the blinds and the doors and exchange information.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "An API in its simplest form is simply a bit of code that allows for two software programs to communicate with each other. APIs act as a sort of set of standards that either permits or denies outside software to request information from the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Not Utilizing API:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An app finds a Delta flight status by going to the Delta Airlines website, searching for the flight number, and interpreting the status of the flight search much like a human would. Without utilizing the capabilities of an API, the app finds the information it is looking for by manually going through all the same steps you would have to go through in order to find the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Utilizing API:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An app finds the Delta flight status by simply sending a message in a standard format (API) to delta.com and the API on the Delta website then returns the status of that flight directly to the app.  \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Uses of API**\n",
    "API use has increased over the last ten years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, many of today’s most commonly used web applications would not even be possible without the use of some form of API. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, every time you share something on social media, an application programming interface is involved. Any time an application allows you to sign in with your Facebook or Google credentials, an API is what syncs that information. Likewise, any application that allows you to import contacts or friends from social media is using API to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most popular APIs currently being used are:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- Google Maps – embeds Google Maps into applications\n",
    "- Google Analytics – allows Google Analytics to access\n",
    "- Youtube API – embeds YouTube players or enables YouTube search capabilities\n",
    "- Social Media – allows native or third-party apps to interact with the social media platform’s functions\n",
    "- Weather Channel – allows weather from The Weather Channel to populate within an application\n",
    "- Dropbox – allows for an app to sync Dropbox files across platforms securely\n",
    "- WordPress – enables WordPress to communicate with other web properties regardless of programming language\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**API use in Transportation**\n",
    "This technology has also found increased usage within the transportation industry, bridging the information gap between shippers, carriers, brokers, and software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "API’s have several uses within the industry, some of the most prevalent of these including:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- Rating – sends quote request to multiple carriers and returns pricing results to requesting application\n",
    "- Transit Times – retrieves standard transit times from multiple carriers\n",
    "- Dispatch – sends carrier pick-up request and responds with pick-up confirmations\n",
    "- Tracking – allows for track and trace information on shipments\n",
    "- Document Retrieval – allows for developers to request shipping documents utilizing a carrier’s tracking number\n",
    "- Expedited Transit Time – allows for developers to get expedited transit times\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    " API offers several advantages with the main one being speed. Requests and responses are exchanged within seconds as opposed to minutes, or in some instances even hours. Other advantages include:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- Internet-based connectivity\n",
    "- Communication is two-way with confirmations included within the transaction sets\n",
    "- Since communication is two-way APIs offer reliable transaction sets\n",
    "- The end product offers user-friendly experiences improving internal and external user satisfaction\n",
    "- Provides evolving functionality as developers find new uses for API exchanges\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "The disadvantages of application programming interfaces include:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementing and providing API capabilities can be costly in terms of development times, ongoing maintenance requirements, and providing support.\n",
    "- Scaling API requires extensive programming knowledge and the learning curve can fairly steep when understanding how to extend the capabilities of your API framework.\n",
    "- Security can be a concern as APIs add another potential attack layer to programs/websites."

    "Web API is an API as the name suggests, it can be accessed over the web using the HTTP protocol. It is a framework that helps you to create and develop HTTP based RESTFUL services. The web API can be developed by using different technologies such as java, ASP.NET, etc. Web API is used in either a web server or a web browser. Basically Web API is a web development concept. It is limited to Web Application’s client-side and also it does not include a web server or web browser details. If an application is to be used on a distributed system and to provide services on different devices like laptops, mobiles, etc then web API services are used. Web API is the enhanced form of the web application.\n",

    "### REST\n",
    "REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, despite its name, it’s language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Something else to keep in mind: Headers and parameters are also important in the HTTP methods of a RESTful API HTTP request, as they contain important identifier information as to the request's metadata, authorization, uniform resource identifier (URI), caching, cookies, and more. There are request headers and response headers, each with their own HTTP connection information and status codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for an API to be considered RESTful, it has to conform to these criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A client-server architecture made up of clients, servers, and resources, with requests managed through HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client information is stored between get requests and each request is separate and unconnected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cacheable data that streamlines client-server interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standard form. This requires that:\n",
    "> - resources requested are identifiable and separate from the representations sent to the client.\n",
    "> - resources can be manipulated by the client via the representation they receive because the representation contains enough information to do so.\n",
    "> - self-descriptive messages returned to the client have enough information to describe how the client should process it.\n",
    "> - hypertext/hypermedia is available, meaning that after accessing a resource the client should be able to use hyperlinks to find all other currently available actions they can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A layered system that organizes each type of server (those responsible for security, load-balancing, etc.) involved the retrieval of requested information into hierarchies, invisible to the client.\n",
    "- Code-on-demand (optional): the ability to send executable code from the server to the client when requested, extending client functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though the REST API has these criteria to conform to, it is still considered easier to use than a prescribed protocol like SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which has specific requirements like XML messaging, and built-in security and transaction compliance that make it slower and heavier. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, REST is a set of guidelines that can be implemented as needed, making REST APIs faster and more lightweight, with increased scalablity—perfect for Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile app development. "

    "Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP) is a network protocol for exchanging structured data between nodes. It uses XML format to transfer messages. It works on top of application layer protocols like HTML and SMTP for notations and transmission. SOAP allows processes to communicate throughout platforms, languages and operating systems, since protocols like HTTP are already installed on all platforms.\n",

    "**The disadvantages of the SOAP protocols are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- SOAP is used only XML format data in web service, whereas JSON and other lightweight formats are not supported by it.\n",
    "- It is slow because it uses XML format, whereas the payload for a simple string message is large.\n",
    "- There are no security features in the SOAP specification.\n",
    "- There is no state reference for the remote object in the SOAP client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Highly complex**\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to Rest, SOAP is significantly more complex. It's also less flexible. This might present a challenge for developers that are not highly skilled. The extensive processing required may also slow down performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. No variety of data formats**\n",

    "\n",
    "**4. Uses more bandwidth**\n",
