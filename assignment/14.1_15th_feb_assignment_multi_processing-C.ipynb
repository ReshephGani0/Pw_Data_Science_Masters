    "Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently. The operating system can then allocate all these threads or processes to the processor to run them parallelly, thus improving the overall performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiprocessing is useful because:\n",
    "Performing multiple operations for a single processor becomes challenging. As the number of processes keeps increasing, the processor will have to halt the current process and move to the next, to keep them going. Thus, it will have to interrupt each task, thereby hampering the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of it as an employee in an organization tasked to perform jobs in multiple departments. If the employee has to manage the sales, accounts, and even the backend, he will have to stop sales when he is into accounts and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are different employees, each to perform a specific task. It becomes simpler, right? That’s why multiprocessing in Python becomes essential. The smaller task threads act like different employees, making it easier to handle and manage various processes. A multiprocessing system can be represented as:\n",

    "- A system with more than a single central processor\n",
    "- A multi-core processor, i.e., a single computing unit with multiple independent core processing units\n",
